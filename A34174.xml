            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his firſt <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> fo. 168. tells us, That the Sheriff hath <hi>Triplicem Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam: (1) Vitae Juſtitiae. (2) Vitae Legis. (3) Vitae Reipublicae,</hi> he thereby gives us a ſhort, but pithy Deſcription of this Important Office. And if <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be the Life of the Law (as without doubt it is) it ſeems to be ſeated in the Sheriff, as in the Heart, which is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens.</hi> Original Proceſs moves and is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him; Subſequent Proceedings are Circulated in him, and at laſt are Finiſhed and compleated by him.</p>
            <p>This gives us to Underſtand, not only the Importance, but the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of the Sheriffs Office. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we Conſider how many Thouſands of Families have Suffered irreparable Ruin by the Ignorance or Careleſſneſs (not to ſay worſe) of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs</hi> and their Officers; Nay, they
<pb facs="tcp:61490:3"/> themſelves failing in the due diſcharg of their Duty, have oftentimes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves <hi>Obnoxious</hi> to charga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Payments and difficult Defences.</p>
            <p>Certainly then, to underſtand well the Law about <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and their fit Management and Demeanor in all the Branches and Circumſtances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their Office, is a thing of as great Conſideration as any that can be propounded to us, as Members of a Body Politick.</p>
            <p>We have indeed many that have Treated of ſome Parts thereof (<hi>inter alia</hi>) as <hi>Crompton, Kitchin, Greenwood &amp;c.</hi> But I know but two that have deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Undertaken this Title.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> (a Perſon of Great Learning and Induſtry) has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much Reading in our Old Books, and is alſo of very great uſe to direct us in CASES that may ſeldom and rarely happen; and yet there is much of him now Antiquated, and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into other Channels. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Fee-farm Rents, Waifs, Eſtrays,
<pb facs="tcp:61490:3"/> Deodands, Wards bona Felonum, &amp;c.</hi> ſeldom or never troubling the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,</hi> having been Extinct or Aliened by Act of Parliament, or granted to Lords of Mannors, or other Perſons.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſome things are there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for Law, and ſo might paſs in his time, which have received quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Reſolutions; and Thouſands of Caſes have hapned ſince, which are not to be found in him, nor in the leaſt mentioned by him. Neither has he been ſo happy as we could wiſh, to Treat Methodically of <hi>Reſcouſers, Eſcapes, &amp;c.</hi> which make a great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in our Books; and he has totally omitted (unleſs it be <hi>ſparſim</hi>) the proper Remedies againſt the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſance</hi> or <hi>Male-feaſance</hi> of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and their Officers. I have, in many Titles, directed you to refer almoſt wholly to him, as not being willing to Tranſcribe them; but they are ſuch as are Common, and known of courſe, or elſe ſeldom or never practicable.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61490:4"/>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is (for ſo much as he hath Undertaken) Neatly and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly done: But as to the Office of <hi>SHERIFFS,</hi> tho' the Book bears that Title; yet it is the leaſt part thereof, not exceeding above Four printed Sheets; ſo that we cannot think that ſufficient Direction to us. Nor have either of them given any Directions as to the Laying of <hi>Actions, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Pleadings,</hi> and <hi>Trials</hi> or <hi>Evidence;</hi> and therefore I have been the more careful to place them under their proper Titles.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Reflections, it ſeems not Unreaſonable to imagine, That a Treatiſe of this Nature may find ſome Acceptance, and meet with a favourable Reception, as well from Gentlemen (who are, or may be capable for this weighty Office, and thereby be better enabled to Serve their King and Country, and alſo Themſelves) as from the <hi>Students</hi> and <hi>Practiſers</hi> of our Common Law.</p>

               <p>HAving treated of Under-ſheriffs, I come now to ſpeak of Bayliffs to the Sheriff, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Bayliffs Errant, or <hi>Ballivi Intinerantes,</hi> or Bayliffs of Hundreds, and Special Bayliffs.</p>
               <p>The making of the Bayliffs of Hundreds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Hundreds (as to the Bayliffwicks of the ſame) are rejoyned to the Counties, and all Grants made of the Bayliff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks of Hundreds ſince that Statute are void, and the making the Bayliffs thereof belongs to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>4 Inſtit. 267. Forteſcues Caſae.</hi> Hundreds cannot be granted from the Sheriff.</note> the Sheriff; as in <hi>Forteſcues Caſe</hi> of <hi>Buckingham Shire, 2 Car. 1.

And ſo,</p>
               <p>A Patent to Execute all Proceſs within an Hundred is void.</p>
               <p>There was a Caſe in 34 <hi>Car. 2. B. R. Cle</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which confirms this reſolution.

                     <p>A ſworn and known Officer (be he Sheriff, Underſheriff, Bayliff or Serjeant) need not ſhew his Warrant, yet upon the Arreſt the Officer ought to declare the Contents of the Warrant, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>

                  <head>Of Bail.</head>
                  <p>BAil is ſo called, becauſe the Party bailed is delivered by Law into the Cuſtody of thoſe that are his Bail, and who are to anſwer the party if they do not produce the Principal to do it.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of Marking the Roll for ſpecial<note place="margin">Special Bail in <hi>B. R.</hi> on <hi>Latitat,</hi> and in <hi>B. C.</hi> on <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>

                  <p>It is the Common Courſe of <hi>London,</hi> upon Plaint before the Sheriffs, and a Precept to the Serjeant to Arreſt one, the Sureties ſhall be found and offered to the Sheriffs, not the Serjeants. So in Inferiour <hi>Mayor</hi>'s Courts, <hi>Widow and Clark's Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in Falſe Impriſonment the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleads the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> That on Entry of a Plaint in <hi>London,</hi> a Serjeant may by Parol, or otherwiſe, Arreſt the Defendant to anſwer the Plaintiff, and ſhews, That <hi>J.

                  <head>Of Bail Bonds. The Explication of the Statute of <hi>23 H. 6.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>This Statute is frequently pleaded in our Books, and many Caſes about the Nature of this Statute; and the Retorns and Pleadings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we meet with, which if methodically digeſted, would be the better and more clearly explained.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſee how the Law was at Common Law, and before the making of this Statute.</p>
                  <p>At Common Law, if the Sheriff had taken any man by the Kings Writ, he muſt not be<note place="margin">Breve de homine Repleg'.</note> delivered but by <hi>Breve de homine replegiando,</hi> and he was not compellable to take Bail of any, 2 <hi>Sand.</hi> 60.</p>
                  <p>But this Statute compels him to take Bail, and the deſign of the Statute is, to provide againſt the Extortion of Sheriffs, who would not deliver them without great ſums, <hi>Cro. El. 808. Sir George Clifton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:61490:59"/>
                  <p>Now the Statute preſcribes the Form, and that<note place="margin">Deſign of this Stat'.</note> the Sheriff under colour of his Office ſhould not oppreſs the party to make him any other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for the Statute makes the Obligation void for not purſuing the Form; but not in the Matter thereof. This Statute was made for the Priſoners benefit; for the miſchief before was, That the Sheriff not being compellable to bail him, would extort Money to bail him, <hi>Mod. Rep. 228.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Statute hath Three Branches, as it is in <hi>Dive and Manningham's Caſe, Plowden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Commandment and Authority to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, to let to Bail' ſuch perſons as are Mainper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: So it extends to Coroners, Stewards of Franchiſes, Bayliffs, Keepers of Priſons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. A Reſtraining branch, That they ſhall not let to Bail ſuch perſons as be in their Ward by Condemnation, Execution, <hi>Capias Utlagat',</hi> or Excommunication, Surety of the Peace, and ſuch as ſhall be Committed by ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Juſtices, nor Vagabonds.</p>
                  <p>3. The third is, to make Obligations void, taken in any other form than the Statute limits; <hi>That no Sheriff, nor any of his Officers and Ministers aforeſaid, ſhall take or cauſe to be taken, or make any Obligation for any Cauſe aforeſaid, or by colour of their Office, but only to themſelves, of any perſon, nor by any perſon which ſhall be in their Ward, by the Courſe of the Law; but by the Name of their Office, and upon Condition written, That the ſaid Priſoners ſhall appear at the Day contained in the ſaid Writ, Bill, or Warrant, and in ſuch places as the ſaid Bill, &amp;c. ſhall require: And any other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation taken by them in any other form, ſhall be void.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61490:60"/>
                  <p>Now there are Three Forms to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is ſhall be made to the Sheriff him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note theſe words <hi>(For any other Cauſe)</hi> refer to all that went before, as well thoſe contained in the Exception, as in the Firſt branch. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Bond taken of a man in Execution is void by this Statute, and the Surety may plead, this was taken by him in Execution as Sheriff, and and the words <hi>colore Officii</hi> make it void; for he he lets him to Bail who is not Mainpernable, <hi>Plowd. 69, 80. Dive and Manningham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Note alſo (<hi>Nor any of his Officers</hi>) it is not<note place="margin">The Stat' miſtaken in print.</note> ſo, and the printed Statute is miſtaken.

                  </p>
                  <p>In Debt on Bond to <hi>Lenthal,</hi> the Defendant pleaded it was for Eaſe; it was held to extend to the Marſhal, tho' he is not one <hi>de ſes Officers</hi> but one <hi>des Officers</hi> and Miniſters of Juſtice, 3 <hi>Keb. 71. Monday and Frogate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Statute be miſ-recited it may be demurred to, as it was in this very Caſe, <hi>Cro. El. 108. Teuſſell and Acton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Statute</hi> are Three Forms to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it ſhall be made to the Sheriff him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Vide infra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it ſhall be made to him by the Name of his Officer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it ſhall be only for Appearance at the day and place, <hi>Cro. El. 862. Cotton and Vale, 2 And. 173. meſme Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61490:60"/>
                  <p>But as to the Inſufficiency of the <hi>Sureties,</hi> that is Matter and not Form, and the Obligation is not void. <hi>Vide infra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Statute</hi> preſcribes the Form, and that the Sheriff under Colour of his Office ſhould not<note place="margin">He muſt purſue the Form, not the Matter.</note> oppreſs the party to make him any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Obligation; for the Statute makes the Obligation void for not purſuing the Form, but not in the Matter thereof: Therefore the sheriff may take one Surety, or one that has no Land in the County, <hi>Cro. El. 808. Sir Geo. Clifton</hi>'s <hi>Caſe, Mod. Rep. 32. Franklyn</hi>'s <hi>Caſe.</hi>

                     <hi>Per Hobart, ex Relatione Twiſden:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Statute</hi> would make ſure work, and not leave it to Expoſitions what Bond ſhould be taken: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was added, That Bonds taken in any other form ſhould be void.</p>

                  <head>Of the Sheriffs Retorn upon taking Bail, and of his taking Inſufficient Bail; or his refuſing ſufficient Bail, and the Remedy: And his pleading in an Action brought againſt him.</head>
                  <p>Note, After the Statute of 23 <hi>H. 6.</hi> the Sheriff cannot make a Special Retorn in a <hi>Capias;</hi> but only a <hi>Cepi Corpus</hi> or <hi>Non eſt inventus:</hi> And the Statute, tho' it compells him to take Bail, yet it does not alter the Retorn.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61490:68"/> and therefore there is no reaſon he ſhould be Charged for not having the Body at the Day.</p>
                  <p>The Retorn of a <hi>Paratum habeo,</hi> is in effect no more than that he hath the Body ready to bring into Court, when the Court ſhall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him.</p>

And therefore <hi>vide Page and Tulſes</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>as to the sheriffs taking Inſufficient bail, and refuſing to take Sufficient bail,</hi> the Law ſtands thus:</p>
                  <p>If the Sheriff refuſe to take Reaſonable Bail, an Action on the Caſe lies againſt him, <hi>Siderfin p. 23.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>If the Sheriff take Inſufficient Bail, yet no Action lies againſt him by the party; for he is Judge of the Bail. <hi>Vide ſupra.</hi> Therefore,</p>
                  <p>In Action on the Caſe againſt the Sheriff for Eſcape. the Defendant pleads the Statute of 23 <hi>H. 6.</hi> that he Lett <hi>H.</hi> to Bail, and took Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Sureties <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> perſons having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent within the County.

                  <p>The Condition of the Bond was, If <hi>Thomas Manningham</hi> keep the Sheriff without damage againſt our Lord the King and one T.

                  <p>The Defendant pleaded the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and that the Body of <hi>Thomas Manningham</hi> was in Execution upon a Recognizance, and that the Sheriff made the Obligation for the delivery of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Manningham,</hi> and demanded<note place="margin">Concluſion of the Plea.</note> Judgment <hi>ſi Actio, i. e.</hi> If the Plaintiff ought to maintain his Action.</p>

                  <p>But a Bond to the Marſhal, &amp;c. to ſave harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from Eſcapes, is void, and within the Statute; becauſe it is not a Bond that he ſhall continue a True Priſoner. <hi>Vide</hi> the Condition, Record and Pleadings, 1 <hi>Sand. 160, 161, 162.

                     <hi>The Sheriff muſt retorn true, and not contrary to the Record;</hi> if he do he falſifies all his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>L.</hi> brought Treſpaſs againſt <hi>J.

                     <hi>The Sheriff is to put his Name to every Retorn made by him, or the Retorn is to be void.</hi> By the Statute of <hi>York 12 Ed. 2. c. 5. 1 Bulſt.</hi> 73. The Statute appoints that he who Retorns ſhall add his Name to the Retorn, and it is ſufficient if it be his Chriſtian Name and Sirname, and the

                     <hi>If the Sheriff arreſt one upon</hi> Mean Proceſs, <hi>and doth not Retorn the VVrit, he is a Treſpaſſor;</hi> and therefore <hi>Stiles Pract. Reg.</hi> 276. is not Law, where he ſaith it is not requiſite that the Sheriff in making a Retorn ſhould inſert his Title or name of Dignity, or Chriſtian or Sirname, but only his Name of Office. Before the Statute of <hi>York, 12 Ed. 2. c. 5. Raſt. Ret. of Sheriffs fol.</hi> 345. no Name was uſed to be put to the Retorn of the Writ by the Sheriff, nor any other Miniſter or Officer which was inconvenient, upon which complaint was made to this Parliament, and ſo remedied.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. is a General Statute, of which the Judges ſhall take notice; but if it does not appear to be a Retorn within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but at Common Law, there for his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance Action lies.

               <p>Action on the Caſe was brought for a Falſe Retorn, <hi>i. e. Cepi corpus,</hi> and yet he had him not at the Day, but ſuffered him to eſcape. The Defendant demurs to the Declaration. Now the Action is good, becauſe the Declaration ſhall be taken to be true upon this Demurrer. And the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. is in part a private Statute, and the Court will not take notice of it without pleading it. But had the Defendant pleaded it Specially, or had he pleaded Not Guilty, he might have had advantage of this Statute, and

After the ſaid Statute the Sheriff cannot make a Special Retorn, but <hi>Cepi corpus,</hi> or <hi>Non eſt inventus.</hi> So that the Caſe of <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> as to that Point, is good Law. For ſuch Action lies not properly againſt the Sheriff, becauſe the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. compels him to Bail the Priſoner; and yet the Sheriff ſhall retorn a <hi>Cepi corpus,</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, <hi>Siderfin p. 439.

But by it miſpriſion of Clarks are only amendable: But it extends not to an Inſufficient Trial, where the <hi>Venue</hi> is miſtaken.

               <p>Now an <hi>Habeas Corpus ad reſpondend</hi>' is, when any one is Impriſoned at the Suit of another upon a Legal Proceſs in the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or any other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon except the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> Priſon, and a third perſon would Sue that Priſoner in this Court (<hi>B.

This is called a <hi>Habeas Corpus cum cauſa;</hi> and an <hi>Habeas Corpus cum cauſa</hi> doth remove the Priſoner for whom it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the Cauſes which are then depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt; him for upon <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to an Inferiour Court, to remove <hi>Corpus cum cauſa,</hi> they ought to return all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cauſes that are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there concerning the Party that hath the <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> (if any of the Cauſes depending be above 5 <hi>l.)

                  <p>A Challenge to the Jurors is Twofold:
<list>
                        <item>To the Array, Polls.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the Array, is, to except againſt all the perſons Impannelled: And as to this there is a
<list>
                        <item>Challenge Principal, or for Favour.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, That the Challenge to the Array is in reſpect of the partiality or default of the Sheriff, or other Officer that made the Retorn, and not in reſpect of the Perſons retorned, where there is no partiality or default in the Sheriff. For if the Challenge to the Array be found againſt the party that takes it; yet he ſhall have his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Challenge to the Polls.</p>
                  <p>If the Sheriff or other Officers be of Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or Affinity to the Plaintiff or Defendant; if the Alliance continue, a good cauſe of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, 1 <hi>Bulstr. 5, 6, 7, 8. Earl of Salop</hi> verſus <hi>Earl of Rutland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Challenge was taken to the Array, becauſe the Sheriff was Couſin to the Leſſor in <hi>Ejectment,</hi> and concludes not to the Favour; its a principal Challenge. Yet in <hi>Roll.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Venire fac</hi>' was awarded to the Coroners on ſurmize, that the Leſſor in <hi>Ejectment</hi> was Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Sheriff. It was doubted, whether it was a Principal Challenge in 1 <hi>Jac. Harbottle</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid, It was Adjudged in 27 <hi>El.</hi> in <hi>Packington</hi>'s Caſe, that it was not a Principal Challenge; but in <hi>Spicer</hi>'s Caſe it is Reſolved otherwiſe, <hi>Cro. Jac. 21. Dyer</hi> 7, 367.</p>
                  <p>If the Challenge be taken for Coſinage, it ought to be ſhewed <hi>coment</hi> Couſin; but in ſuch caſe Challenge to a Juror, is not neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Its clearly a good Challenge to the Array, that the Sheriff is Couſin to the Wife of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, tho' the Wife is no party to the Action: But it muſt be averred, that ſhe was alive, or had Iſſue at the making of the Pannel.</p>
                  <p>1. If the Jury may try a Challenge for Coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the Sheriff to the Plaintiff or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and ſometime the Coroners, or Attorneys in Court, are Eliſors, 2 <hi>Roll. Rep. 363. Lloyd and</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Defendant challenge the Array, for that the Sheriff is Couſin to the Plaintiff; it is no Counterplea of the Challenge that the Sheriff is alſo Couſin to the Defendant; but the Array ſhall be quaſht, becauſe the Defendant firſt took the Challenge, <hi>Paſch. 41 El. B. R.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If any one or more of the Jury be retorned at at the denomination of the party, Plaintiff or Defendant, the whole Array ſhall be quaſht.</p>
                  <p>3. If the Plaintiff or Defendant have an Action of <hi>Battery</hi> or <hi>Debt</hi> againſt the Sheriff, or if the Sheriff have parcel of the Land depending on the ſame Title; or if the Sheriff or his Bayliff be either of Counſel or Attorney, or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61490:105"/> Servant or Goſſip of either party; all the Array ſhall be quaſht.</p>
                  <p>A Prayer to <hi>Eliſors</hi> in Trials at Bar may be at<note place="margin">Eliſors.</note> the Suit of the Defendant or Plaintiff; but in <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> at the Prayer of the Plaintiff only.</p>
                  <p>Conſanguinity or Affinity are the principal Cauſes; but its no Challenge to the Array, if all the Jurors be of Affinity.</p>
                  <p>Challenge to the Array for Favour, That the Sheriff is Servant to the Plaintiff, or was Arbitrator for a party: That the Sheriff purchaſed part of the Land in queſtion: That one party is Tenant or Servant to the Sheriff.</p>
                  <p>Malice between the Sheriff and one of the parties, is good cauſe of Challenge, That one of the parties has brought an Action of <hi>Debt</hi> againſt the Sheriff, &amp;c. but not that the Officer has Debt againſt the party; for he may demand his Debt without Malice.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Challenge being no principal Challenge, muſt be left to the Conſcience and diſcretion of the Tryors.</p>
                  <p>Challenge to the Polls, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the particular<note place="margin">Challenge to the Poll.</note> Jurors; and theſe are of four ſorts:</p>
                  <p>1. Peremptory, without ſhewing any Cauſe; and this for Treaſon is 35. Felony 20.</p>
                  <p>2. Principal Challenge to the Polls; ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe it ſtands of it ſelf, without leaving any thing to the Conſcience or Diſcretion of the Tryors. Now this is ſuch Matter as proves evident Favour or Enmity in the Juror.</p>
                  <p>And this is, <hi>Propter reſpectum;</hi> as the Nobility may be challenged, or he may challenge himſelf, <hi>propter defectum,</hi> as Aliens, Villains; not having Freehold ſufficient; not having two Hundredors. <hi>Propter affectum,</hi> as Jurors of Kin or Blood to either party; that he has formerly Tried the Cauſe; Counſel; not a Commiſſioner for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61490:105"/> Examination of Witneſſes; Fellow-Servant; for Favour; <hi>propter delictum,</hi> as Outlaw'd, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. Challenger to the Poll muſt ſhew Cauſe preſently. After one hath taken Challenge to the Poll, he cannot challenge the Array.</p>
                  <p>4. If the Plaintiff alledge a Cauſe of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge againſt the Sheriff, the Proceſs ſhall be directed to the Coroners; and if any Cauſe againſt all the Coroners, then the Court ſhall appoint Eliſors. Sometime, two of them that be<note place="margin">Eliſors.</note> Impannelled.</p>
                  <p>When any Challenge is made to the Poll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, two Tryors ſhall be appointed by the Court.</p>
                  <p>Note, All Challenges muſt be taken before the Jurors are ſworn.</p>
                  <p>No Challenge ſhall be admitted againſt the Tryors, appointed by the Court.</p>
                  <p>There may be a Challenge to the Pannel by Exception to the Sheriff, after a <hi>Tales</hi> prayed to him: So after a <hi>Venire fac'</hi> prayed to him, tho' the cauſe of Challenge were before the Prayer, <hi>Hob. p.</hi> 235.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Sheriff was <hi>quondam</hi> Servant to the Defendant, Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> is no principal Challenge, its paſt and executed. <hi>Aliter,</hi> had it been ſo at the time.</p>
                  <p>To ſay, That between the Sheriff or Officer that retorns the Pannel, and one of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, there was an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, is a principal Challenge.</p>

                  <p>Where and in what Caſes the Sheriffs Retorn of a <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> ſhall be good or not, and the late practice in ſuch Caſes.</p>

               <p>THe Defendant pleads <hi>plene adminiſtravit,</hi> and<note place="margin">Sheriff concluded to make any retorn, contrary to the Verdict.</note> Verdict is for the Plaintiff, this eſtops the Sheriff of the County where the Trial was to Retorn <hi>Nulla bona;</hi> for he is concluded by the Verdict to make any Retorn contrary to it; but the Sheriff of another County ſhall not be ſo concluded. But the Sheriff of the County where the Writ is brought ought to Retorn a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> and thereupon the Plaintiff ſhall have Proceſs into another County, 2 <hi>Leon. n. 90. p. 67.

               <p>The principal Caſe was; Debt in <hi>London</hi> againſt an Executor, upon <hi>plene adminiſtravit</hi> it was found for the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and a <hi>Scire fac</hi>' iſſued out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> againſt the Defendant, &amp;c. into the County of <hi>D.</hi> and the Sheriff retorned <hi>Nulla bona, &amp;c.</hi> which was not good, <hi>cauſa qua ſupra,</hi> tho' the Debt was well aſſigned.

                  <p>The Sheriff may remove his Gaol from one<note place="margin">The place where to be kept.</note> place to another within his Bailywick. And the Sheriff may hold the <hi>Aſſizes</hi> in the Caſtle where he held them there by Preſcription, altho' the King grant the Cuſtody of the Caſtle to another. So that tho' the Sheriff may keep the Gaol in what place he will within his Bailywick, yet in a particular place not without Preſcription, <hi>Heb. p. 202. 1 Anderſ.</hi> 345.</p>

As in many places in the Realm, the Gaol of a Town, which is a County of it ſelf, or a place priviledged from the County, is the Gaol of the County, and the place where the Aſſizes or Gaol-delivery is holden, is within the County of the Town, and yet ſerves alſo for the County at large: As in the Seſſions-Hall at <hi>Newgate,</hi> which ſerves as well for the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> as for <hi>London,</hi> and yet it ſtands in <hi>London;</hi> but by Uſage it hath been ſo.

It is true, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is amazing; but as the ſins of every Age grow more impudent, ſo their penalties ought to be more ſevere: And if we will tranſlate our Neighbouring Nations Villanies, we ought to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61490:111"/> imitate their puniſhments; eſpecially for Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces publick, and which go to the ruin of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I will put a common Inſtance. At this preſent our current Trade is almoſt ſpoiled by our Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Money, and he that ſhall break open a Bakers Window to take a Sixpeny Loaf to ſupply meer Nature, ſhall be as ſeverely treated, as' he that Clips and Counterfeits the Coyn; I mean, a little dry Hanging ſerves for both; for as to the Sledge, its inſignificant.

                  <p>Tho' there is no perſon that has a greater Veneration for our Common Law than my ſelf; yet I conceive I may ſay, the ſpreading and new Villanies of our Nation are chiefly owing to our undiſtinguiſhing puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>He that takes but Half a Crown on the Pad ſhall be hanged, and deſervedly; and he that Blaſphemes his God, Murders his Father, and commits a Rape upon his Mother, ſhall e'en make his <hi>Exit</hi> with a few wry wet Looks, and a little Swing or two: Which puniſhment I muſt needs obſerve is almoſt grown into Contempt by the major part of Criminals.</p>
                  <p>I need but mention the notorious Caſe of <hi>Felton;</hi> and the late Story of the barbarous Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.</p>

                  <p>And therefore if a man dye in Priſon, the Coroner ought to ſit upon him, to the end it may be enquired, if he came to his death by the dureſs of the Gaoler, or otherwiſe, 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 91. 52.</p>

                  <p>The Caſe was,
<q>A Joynt Termor of an Houſe with <hi>B.</hi> dies, being bound in a Statute. The Sheriff Retorns him dead, Conuſee Sues another Writ to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Lands, which he had at the time of his death or after, and what Goods he had at the time of his death: The Sheriff Impanels a Jury to enquire what Goods, &amp;c. and it was found there were divers Goods of the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed at the Houſe of <hi>B.</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> And the Sheriff came with the Jury to view Appraiſe, and ſeiſe them for this Debt, and the (Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant) Surviving <hi>Termor, premiſſorum non igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſhut the Door, and diſturbed him to make Execution.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was reſolved,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Upon Recovery the Sheriff may break<note place="margin">On habere fac' poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem.</note> open an Houſe, and deliver it to the Plaintiff; for the Writ ſaith, <hi>habere fac' ſeiſinam,</hi> or <hi>poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem.</hi> And after Judgment it is not the Houſe of the Defendant in Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> upon a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciend</hi>', the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may not break open any Mans Houſe to make Execution; but in all caſes, when the Door is open the Sheriff may Enter to make Execution of Body or Goods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all Caſes where the King is Party, ſo on <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry,</hi> if no Door be open, the Sheriff may break open the Houſe to take him, or to do Execution or other Proceſs; as upon a <hi>Cap' Utlagat</hi>', or upon Contempt: But he ought firſt to ſignifie the Cauſe of his coming, and requeſt the Owner to open the Door, but not to break open any Mans Houſe by night.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:61490:115"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon a <hi>Fieri fac</hi>', or <hi>Extendi fac</hi>', the Sheriff may not enter into the Houſe of any, the Door being ſhut, nor draw a Latch no not after requeſt and denyal; yet tho' the Sheriff be a Treſpaſſor in breaking open the Houſe by <hi>Fieri fac</hi>', yet the Execution is Good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Houſe of any one is not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged but for himſelf and his Family, and his own proper Goods, not to protect any who flie there, or the Goods of another conveyed there; and in ſuch caſe after requeſt, the Sheriff may break open the Door; but in the principal Caſe he did not requeſt it, and ſo the ſhutting the Door by the Defendant was lawful, and no Action lies againſt him. And as for the Allegation of (<hi>premiſſorum non ignarus</hi>) it is too general, and Notice ought to be ſpecially alledged, that he<note place="margin">Notice.</note> was Sheriff and what he came to do; and the Defendant being a Stranger to the Execution, he is not bound to take notice of the Sheriffs intent.</p>
                  <p>Upon a <hi>Fieri fac</hi>', a Barn which ſtands in the Field may be broken by the Sheriff, becauſe it is not part of the Dwelling-houſe, and there needs no requeſt, <hi>aliter</hi> had the Barn been adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and parcel of the Houſe, <hi>Siderfin 186, 187.

                  </p>
                  <p>But tho' a Sheriff cannot break open a Houſe, being to take Execution by <hi>Fieri fac</hi>', yet when the Door is open that he enters, then he may and ought to break open the Door of an Entry or Chamber which is locked, or break open any Cheſt which is locked and take the Goods, and if he do not, an Action of the Caſe lies againſt him, 1 <hi>Browl.

                  <p>Diverſity was taken in <hi>White and Wiltſhires caſe,</hi> where the Execution is lawfully begun, there the Sheriff or his Officers may break the Houſe to mak Execution, otherwiſe, when it is not lawfully begun. If one be Arreſted by the Sheriff and he eſcapeth to his own Houſe, and the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff perſues him and breaks open the Doors of his Houſe, and takes him again, the party ſhall never take benefit of this his own wrongful eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</p>
                  <p>Two of the under Sheriffs Bayliffs entred into the Houſe, the Door being open, to take Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goods, and the Plaintiff ſhuts the Door upon the Bayliffs, and impriſoned them for two hours; the Sheriff may break open the Houſe to Reſcue his Bayliffs. <hi>Cro. Jac. 555. White and Wiltſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, the Sheriff was fined for breaking open an Houſe, and ruſhing in with Sword drawn, the Door being half open, on private Proceſs. By the <hi>Stat. W. 1. c.</hi> 15. the Sheriff may break open an Houſe or Caſtle to make Replevin when the Goods of another are Conveyed there. 5 <hi>Rep. Semain</hi>'s <hi>Caſe.</hi>

                  <p>If a Bankrupt convey his Goods to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Houſe, the Serjeant Commiſſioners may not, but the Sheriff may break open the Houſe, becauſe he is a ſworn Officer of the Kings <hi>Goodwins Law against Bankrupts 65. Quer.</hi>

                  <p>Upon a Commiſſion of Rebellion out of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, the Sheriff may break open the Houſe to apprehend the party therein, whether in his own or anothers Houſe. <hi>Cromp. fo.</hi> 47.</p>
                  <p>The Sheriff may take the <hi>poſſe Comitat.</hi> to do Execution <hi>Per Stat. W. 2. c.</hi> 39. and he may take it <hi>poſt vel ante querimoniam,</hi> but he may take it after reſiſtance, and not before; for <hi>ſequi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet

For tho' the Sheriff might have ſold the Term upon this Writ; yet here is not any Vendition to a Stranger, but a delivery of a Term to the party who recovers, by way of Extent without any Sale, and therefore the Owner ſhall be reſtored: For the Sheriff is not bound by this Writ to ſell the Term, as he is in a <hi>Fieri fac', Paſch. 16 Car.

                  <p>Now the Sheriff is to be careful in the ſale<note place="margin">Recital of a Term in the Sale of it.</note> of a Term on <hi>Elegit,</hi> if he make particular Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that there be no miſtake. But a general Recital is better: As,</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Ejectment</hi> it was found by Special Verdict, that the Sheriff upon an <hi>Elegit</hi> impannelled a Jury, who found that the Defendant was poſſeſſed of a Leaſe for 100 years, which began at <hi>Mich.</hi> 2 &amp; 3 of <hi>Ph. &amp; M. ubi revera,</hi> as it was found it begun <hi>Mich.</hi> 3 &amp; 4 of <hi>Ph. &amp; M. cujus quidem</hi> H. <hi>statum intereſſe &amp; terminum in tenementis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictis praedict.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Inqueſt found one thing, and he ſells another (as this Caſe was,) and the Sale not being warranted by the Inqueſt is void. But had the Inqueſt found he had been poſſeſſed of ſuch Land generally for the Term of divers years to come, and they had Appraiſed it for ſo much, without ſhewing the certain beginning or determination, it had been well enough, for they ſhall not be compelled to find a Certainty, not having means to be informed thereof; or if the Sheriff ſells all ſuch Intereſt which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had in the ſame Term, the Sale had been good, 5 <hi>Rep.

                  <p>Note, the Court never ſines a Sheriff for the ill retorn of a Reſcous, becauſe it is voluntary, but they allow exceptions to quaſh it, becauſe the party cannot Traverſe it: But where he is compellable to make a Retorn, he is finable, but the party ſhall have his Action on the Caſe.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61490:152"/> Yet in <hi>Chamber</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Keb.</hi> 358. the Sheriff is Finable for retorning a Reſcous on <hi>Fi. fac</hi>'; but the Retorn is well enough as to the party, 1 <hi>Keb. 878. Burrough</hi>'s Caſe, 1 <hi>Roll. Rep. 389. Proby and Lumley.</hi>

                  <p>Now as to the Ill Retorns of <hi>Reſcous,</hi> and the Exception to quaſh it, I ſhall briefly cite the Caſes Adjudged in our Books, for the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Direction of ſuch Retorns hereafter to be made.</p>
                  <p>The Retorn of a Reſcous, without mentioning<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn muſt mention the place where it was made.</note> the place where it was made, is void.

Exception was taken, becauſe he ſaith not (<hi>infra ballivam meam.</hi>) But <hi>non allocatur;</hi> for if it be within the County, it cannot otherwiſe be taken, but to be within his Bailywick, <hi>Mo.</hi> 422.</p>
                  <p>Upon a <hi>Latitat</hi> awarded, the Sheriff retorns a Reſcous <hi>tali die;</hi> but there is not any place mentioned where the Arreſt was made. Its a void Retorn. For <hi>non conſtat,</hi> whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Reſcous were within the County and Juriſdiction of the Sheriff, <hi>Yelv. p. 51. Woolfrost</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>The Sheriff retorned a Reſcous againſt the Father and Son; againſt the Father for reſcuing his Son, and againſt the Son for reſcuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to the Father, the Retorn was ſufficient as to time and place: But that againſt the Son wanted ſuch Certainty.</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:61490:153"/>
                  <p>By <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> The Retorn is good: It ſhall be intended at the ſame time that the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued the Son, that the Son reſcued himſelf, and the word (<hi>Et</hi>) is a Conjunction Copulative; and compleats both together.</p>

                  <p>The Sheriff in his retorn of Reſcous ſaid, That he was in <hi>Cuſtodia ballivi Itinerantis,</hi> and that a Reſcous was made to his Bayliff Itinerant. Its not good. <hi>Aliter,</hi> if it had been Bayliff of a Liberty, <hi>March. Rep. p.</hi> 92.</p>

                  <p>The Sheriff ought not to ſay, He reſcouſed<note place="margin">To ſay, he reſcued him out of the Cuſtody of the Bayliff, is not good.</note> him out of the Cuſtody of his Bayliff, but out of the Cuſtody of the Sheriff: But it is good, if it were by the Bayliff of a Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Retorn of a Reſcous was not quaſht for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>in custodia</hi> for <hi>è custodia;</hi> but becauſe he ſaith <hi>cepit &amp; arreſtavit,</hi> and not <hi>in cuſtodia habuit,</hi> it was quaſht; for an Arreſt may be only by word, 2 <hi>Keb. 177. The King againſt Claypoole,</hi> and <hi>p. 227. The King againſt Sympſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Exception was to the retorn of a Reſcous, becauſe it was <hi>è cuſtodia ballivi mei. Sed non allocatur;</hi> for there is <hi>veritas legis &amp; veritas facti,</hi> and if either be alledged its ſufficient; therefore its as good as if it had been <hi>è cuſtodia mea.</hi> But <hi>Keeling</hi> held it ill; becauſe a Retorn muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Law, and the difference has alwas been between a Sheriffs Bayliff, and a Bayliff of a

                  <p>If the Sheriff retorn <hi>in Banco</hi> a Reſcous made to his Bayliff Errant by theſe words, <hi>viz.

This Retorn is not good, becauſe this Arreſt is the proper Arreſt of the Sheriff, and no credit is to be given to the Bayliff Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Mich. 8 Jac. in Scaccario, Kent and Heltway</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>per Cur.</hi> ſuch a Retorn in <hi>Banco Regis</hi> is good enough, becauſe the Preſidents of the the Court are accordingly; and ſuch Retorn by a Bayliff of a Franchiſe in <hi>B. R.</hi> is good.</p>
                  <p>Tho' its faid 2 <hi>Roll. Rep.</hi> 78. the Sheriff ought to retorn Reſcous made to him, and not to his Bayliff, yet in truth the Force is made to his Bayliff; but it is according to the different courſe of the Courts.</p>
                  <p>Two Exceptions were taken to the Retorn of a Reſcous:</p>

                  <p>A Reſcous was retorned in this manner by the Sheriff; (<hi>viz.</hi>) in the Recital of the Arreſt he ſaid, <hi>Mandavi ballivo, &amp;c. qui virtute praedicti Warranti arreſtavit, &amp;c.</hi> and after ſhews the Reſcous.</p>
                  <p>Exception was, He Commands his Bayliffs to<note place="margin">In the Retorn he makes no mention of his Warrant.</note> Arreſt, and ſaith, That by virue of the ſaid Warrant they did Arreſt, &amp;c. and makes no mention of any Warrant, but of his Command to them. Had this been to a Bayliff of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty it had been good; but not to thoſe which are Bayliffs Itinerants.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>per Cur</hi>', he cannot Command a Bayliff of a Liberty, but by his Warrant.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Clerk of the Crown</hi> ſaid, The Common Form is, <hi>Feci quoddam Warrantum;</hi> but to a Bayliff of a Liberty it is <hi>Mandavi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A General Warrant to a Bayliff of a Liberty (<hi>viz.</hi>) for all Arreſts is good; but not to a Bayliff Itinerant, by <hi>Haughton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by Sir <hi>James Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, Tho' the Common Form be <hi>Feci quoddam Warrantum,</hi> yet this tantamounts: For the Mandate of the Sheriff to the Bayliff is the Bayliffs Warrant. However a Reſcouſer as to this cannot take advantage, but ſhall be fined to the King, 2 <hi>Roll. Rep.</hi> 263.</p>
                  <p>The Sheriff retorns a Reſcous, and recites<note place="margin">The time and place where the Warrant was made, not ſhewed in the Retorn.</note> where a <hi>Latitat</hi> was to him directed, &amp;c. he made his Warrant to the Bayliff, who arreſted <hi>W.</hi> and that <hi>G.</hi> made the Reſcous.

                  <p>Tho the Proceſs of the Court be Erroneous, yet the Sheriff ſhall not be chargable on Eſcape; as if firſt <hi>Capias</hi> be by a wrong name, and the <hi>Teſtatum</hi> by a right name; ſo if one who is in Execution by a <hi>Capias ad ſatiſfaciend.</hi> on a Recognizance, tho the <hi>Capias</hi> is erroneouſly awarded, yet the Sheriff is Chargeable. Yet this is not Law, for a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias ad ſatisfaciend'</hi> lies on a Recognizance, as in <hi>Ognell and Paſtons Caſe. 1 Leon. 2 Bulſt. 256. Keyſar and Tirrel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So of a <hi>Capias</hi> awarded without a <hi>Fi. fac. Cro. Eliz. 576. Conyers Caſe. Cro Eliz. 188 Buſhes</hi> Caſe.</p>
                  <p>So that he is not to take advantage of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror<note place="margin">Diverſity.</note> in the proceedings, otherwiſe it is where he can alledge a nullity in the Record; and if the Court award a <hi>Capias</hi> where it lies not to the Sheriff, by force of which he takes the party, and then ſuffers him to Eſcape, he ſhall be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he is not to diſpute the Authority of the Court.</p>
                  <p>Another difference is, where the Court hath<note place="margin">Diverſity, where the Court has Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cauſe, and where not.</note> Juriſdiction of the Cauſe and where not; where the Court hath Juriſdiction, and doth Miſaward Proceſs, this is but Error: But if the Court hath no Juriſdiction and doth Miſaward Proceſs, there all is void, and the Sheriff may ſhew this in diſcharge of himſelf: As if a <hi>Formedon</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced Originally in <hi>B. R.</hi> or an <hi>Appeal</hi> in the <hi>Common-Bench,</hi> all is void, and no Action of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape lies againſt the Sheriff; as <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61490:166"/> 
                     <hi>Hull</hi> is a limitted Juriſdiction, and they hold Plea of a Bond made out of their Juriſdiction, and thereupon a <hi>Capias</hi> was awarded againſt the Obligor, who being Arreſted on it, Eſcapes, no Action lies againſt the Sheriff, and this is the difference in the Caſe of the <hi>Marſhallſea.</hi> But this is more fully reported in <hi>Rolls Abrig. 2 Bulſt. 62. Weaver and Clifford, Ognell and Parſtons Caſe. 8. Rep.</hi> 243. Dr. <hi>Drurys's Caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Action on the Caſe is brought in <hi>B. R.</hi> againſt the Officer in an Inferior Court upon Eſcape, if the Plaintiff declare that he brought an Action againſt <hi>I. S.</hi> in the ſaid Inferiour Court (<hi>as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> upon <hi>Hull</hi>) on an Obligation made at <hi>Haly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> in <hi>Com' Ebor'</hi> and does not alledge this to be within the Juriſdiction of the ſaid Inferiour Court, and upon this Judgment was given and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution granted, and the Defendant took him in Execution and ſuffered him to Eſcape, and upon this he brings his Action. 1 <hi>Rol. Abrig. 809. Richardſan and Bernard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Declaration is not ſufficient to charge the<note place="margin">Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Tho the Action be Tranſient, yet if brought in Inferiour Court, the cauſe of Action muſt be alledged, to ariſe there.</note> Defendant, becauſe it is not alledged, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was made within the Juriſdiction of the Court; for altho the Action be Tranſitory, yet this Inferiour Court had a Limited Juriſdiction of things ariſing within the Juriſdiction, and the proceedings there were <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and utterly void, of which the Officer ſhall take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this Action for the Eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole we may ſee that the Caſe. of <hi>Warren and Clifford</hi> is miſreported in <hi>Yel. p.</hi> 42. where 'tis ſaid, it was held by three Judges that the Action did not lie, becauſe he was not a Priſoner by the courſe of Law, for he was in Execution upon a <hi>Capias ad ſatiſfaciend.</hi> on a Recognizance, which lay not, but a <hi>Sci. fac.</hi> and therefore ſaith that Book, he being taken by <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61490:167"/> ſatiſfaciend.</hi> he is not a Priſoner by Courſe of Law, for the Law has not ordained any ſuch means to Arreſt him, and he being in Cuſtody without Warrant 'its no Eſcape. But this is a double miſtake, for a <hi>Capias ad ſatiſfaciend.</hi> has been adjudged to lie on a Recognizance, and if it did not, yet 'its but Erroneous Proceſs, of which the Sheriff ſhall not take advantage.</p>
                  <p>In Caſe upon Eſcape againſt the Sheriff of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> for ſuffering one <hi>M. W.</hi> to Eſcape out of Execution; and ſhews a Recovery againſt him in <hi>B.

                     <note place="margin">Erroneous Proceſs, becauſe the Warrant varies from the command to the Sheriff of <hi>Com. pal. Laneaſter.</hi>
                     </note> and a Writ was awarded to the Chancellor of the County Palatine of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> that he ſhould command the Sheriff to take the ſaid <hi>I. M. ad ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Error was brought becauſe the Writ directed by the Chancellor to the Sheriff, was not warranted by the Writ directed to him, for it varies from the command, for it ought to have been that the Sheriff ſhould have the Body before the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>ita quod</hi> that he ſhould have him before the Juſtices, <hi>Sed non allocat</hi>' for tho there be Error in the Proceſs, the Sheriff ſhall not take any advantage thereof, but having ſuffered him to Eſcape he is reſponſible to the party. <hi>Cro. Jac. 288. Burton and Eyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the Sheriff ſhall not take advantage of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the Proceſs, as in <hi>B. R.</hi> the Plaintiff had Judgment to recover more than was due to him. 2 <hi>Sand. p. 100. Jaques and Lockart.</hi>

                  <head>Where the Eſcape of one ſhall be a diſcharge of the other or not, and where the other ſhall have <hi>Audita Querela</hi> or not, Vide Supra.</head>
                  <p>Two are bound joyntly and ſeverally, and one is in Execution, and the Gaoler ſuffers him to Eſcape voluntarily, this cannot be pleaded by the other, for it is no diſcharge of the Debt, and by conſequence the Action lies againſt the other; now where two are bound joyntly and ſeverally, one was condemned and taken in Execution, and after the other was ſued condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and taken, the firſt Eſcapes, the other ſhall not have <hi>Audita Querela:</hi> Becauſe it muſt be an Execution with ſatisfactio; and tho the firſt may have Debt on Eſcape againſt the Sheriff yet

And if this Action would not lye, it would be a miſchievous caſe; for as ſoon as the Creditor
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61490:172"/> dies, the Gaoler may ſuffer the Priſoner to eſcape, becauſe none may have Action againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Two Judges were againſt two.</p>

                     <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s diverſity was, This Perſonal <hi>Tort</hi> may be conſidered in two reſpects; as a Crime puniſhable, and that is gone; or as a <hi>Tort</hi> to the party; and then it is but reaſonable that the Executor ſhould have remedy.</p>
                  <p>But it is agreed by all, according to <hi>Fitzh. N. B.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">After Judgment.</note> 121. That if it were upon Eſcape after Judgment, that the Action would lye by the Executor; therefore <hi>quaere</hi> as to <hi>Wade</hi>'s Caſe 2 <hi>Keb.</hi> 616. The Executor moved for a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Defendant, eſcaped out of Execution in the time of the Teſtator, and that the <hi>Committitur</hi> then entred may be vacated. <hi>Per Cur.</hi> albeit the party or the Gaoler on Negligent eſcape, or the party on Wilful eſcape may take him again, yet not by a New Proceſs or <hi>Capias</hi> after a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur;</hi> nor can the Executors have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Stile</hi>'s Rep. <hi>p. 32.

               <p>AS for the Periods of Time wherein the manner of the Sheriffs Accompting to the King have been altered by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Practice, you may peruſe a Learned Treatiſe of the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> touching Sheriffs Accompts. You find there how the King's Farms were anciently Anſwered by the Sheriffs, and the manner of the Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kings Revenues of the County.</p>
               <p>Now that which was <hi>Firmi Comitatus,</hi> were the <hi>Vicountiel Rents,</hi> and they came under various denominations, (<hi>viz.) Blanch-Rents, Albo firmae Praeſtatio pro pulchrè placitando, Viſus Frankpledg', Redditus ad Turnum, Certum Letae;</hi> and theſe were in time contracted to a ſort of Annual Revenues.</p>
               <p>And the uncertain Annual Revenue was called <hi>Proficuum Comitatus,</hi> which in ancient Times was conſiderable, when moſt Law-Suits were Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in Counties and in Hundred Courts, Fines, Iſſues and Amerciaments in thoſe Courts; and in thoſe elder Times they were conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>The Farm of the Bailywick of one County was let at 100 <hi>l. per Annum temp. H.</hi> 3. but by <hi>Stat. 27. H. 6. c.</hi> 10. the Sheriff is reſtrained from Letting his Bailywick to Farm.</p>
               <p>But theſe were formerly, and now are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered at two Terms in the year, <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> and <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and are called <hi>proferae Vicecomitis,</hi> or Sheriffs proffers. But it is as it were a Mock-payment
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61490:226"/> (now being ſo inconſiderable, moſt Cauſes being tryed in Superiour Courts) for upon Account he generally has all his Proffers paid and allowed to him again.</p>

               <p>Since the Statute of 34 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 16. the Sheriffs might diſcharge themſelves of the Caſual Charges, or Annual uncertain Charges, and moſt ordinarily after this Statute did diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the entire <hi>Firmae de proficuis Comitatus;</hi> and they aſcertained to the Court, that there were no ſuch profits beyond the charge in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them, or that the charge of keeping the County Court, the Tourn and Hundred Courts, which were the things that made up the <hi>Firma de proficuis</hi> ſurmounted the benefit: And this Making appear, was no other than the Oath of the Sheriff, and the Statute gives him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
               <p>Yet tho' the Sheriffs did uſe to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Oaths of the entire <hi>Fermae de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficuis Comitatus,</hi> and of a great part of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countiels;</hi> yet till <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1650. theſe entire Farms were conſtantly written out in Charge to the Sheriff upon the Summons of the Pipe, tho' it was but a piece of Formality.</p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Firmae de proficuo Comisat</hi>' is wholly put out of the Charge of the ſummons of the Pipe, by an Order made in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> 1650, which is followed to this day.</p>
